# DojoMeetUp

Dojo Meet Up is a full stack web application that allows registered users to create, join, view, update, and delete events and meetups that they or other users have created. 
This web application uses ASP.NET CORE for Front-end and Back-end frameworks and structure, as well as registration authentication 
and password hashing and storing - providing a unified C# full-stack build. 
Bootstrap is used for its simple but modern UI.
